# NimsRaceTo100_AlexaSkill
Created a game based on Nim in order to learn about state changes with Alexa skills for future skills

--- Skill Description ---
The Nim's Race to 100 skill was designed as a fun little Math game which is based off of the game Nim.

You and Alexa will start from 0 and alternatively add a number from 1 to 10 to the sum. The player who reaches 100 wins!

- After enabling the skill, to start a game just say "open nim's race" then say a number from 1 to 10 when prompted.
- If you miss what Alexa says just say "repeat" to have her say it again.
- If you want to change the difficulty of the game say "change the difficulty to easy", "change the difficulty to medium", or "change the difficulty to hard".
- If at any time you want to stop playing just say "exit".

If you haven't played Nim or a variation of it before, try figuring out the trick!

Will add these features if there is interest: ability to set the goal number at beginning of a match, ability to change the max increment from 10 at the beginning of a match, and ability to choose who goes first
